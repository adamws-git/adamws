After deactivating Instagram and reflecting on how I want connect with you all, I've landed on the ultimate 2000's technological phenomenon. A blog. 

Coming into 2025, one of my goals was to do more long-form writing and more storytelling so a blog like this seems like the perfect creative outlet. 

I imagine the sort of posts you'll find on here are;

1. Trip diaries and reflections
2. Photo dumps (a la Instagram c. 2024)
3. Musings and brain dumps

I'll also email you though a newsletter whenever I post, if you'd prefer to hear about my life in your inbox.

Love x Adam
