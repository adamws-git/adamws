Last September, my partner and I headed across the ditch to Aotearoa/NZ for two weeks of exploration and adventure. While we had initial grand plans to do a couple of overnight hikes alongside a 'vanlife' roadtrip, the logistics to run both trips at the same time were too difficult.

## Welcome to Queenstown

Having arrived in Queenstown, we checked into our Airbnb–which was right at the top of a very steep hill mind (welcome to NZ lol). I'd organised the Uber to take us into the town centre due to the fact the Airbnb was meant to be walking distance. It was, hill and all included. Lesson learnt.

We'd arranged to have a few days in Queenstown proper to explore what is probably one of my favourite towns. It's like a ski resort on steroids–everyone there is there to have fun, forget about the corporate lifestyle and enjoy everything mother nature has to offer.

While in Queenstown, we hit a few of the OGs; the Shotover Jet, Ferg Burger as well as some of the lesser undertaken–we walked up towards Ben Lomond from the town centre, up the Tiwi trail and past the luge. More uphill.

## The van

Finding a van was really very easy. If the common joke about sheep in NZ applies, so should one about vans. They're everywhere. We found ours on a site called Camplify–which is a bit like Airbnb for vans and cars. People who may own a van and don't use it full time can rent it out at a daily cost, while the renter pays for fuel and tolls.

For a whopping NZD$100 a day, we had scored a _memorable_ Toyota Hiace from 1990. Makes it older than yours truly. 

We’re talking no airbags, no power steering, no A/C and a top speed of 40km/h at the mere sight of a slope. 

I loved it. 

The owners had fitted it out with a decent setup; bed, cabinetry (including a sink!) and a battery for the small fridge and electronics for when you’re parked up.

## The trip

### Day 1

We headed off from Queenstown towards Kinloch, a small town on the shoreline of Lake Whakatipu (same as Queenstown). Another 20mins on from the township was a DOC campground that looked to have great views and bare bones facilities, making it the perfect shakedown spot for the van.

Arriving, it was quiet and still. There was the campground, right on the shore. A small guest house that looked like it had been there for centuries, and then a couple of houses partially obscured by trees. There were a few other groups already set up; a couple of climbers, another couple of 'vanlifers' and a large caravan whose owners we didn't see much. 

We settled in for the evening, making dinner and escaping the sandflies that descend as soon as the sun sets.

### Day 2

Staying in kinloch for another night, we headed for the trailhead of the Routebourn track. One of NZ's great walks, we were only doing a day's out and back from it but I would love to go back to complete all 4/5 days of it.

The walk was stunning. Crossing about 5 suspension bridges, there's nothing I can compare it to in Australia. You walk along RIVER NAME, with its glacial blue water streaming below the towering peaks above.

Post-walk, we returned to Kinloch campground and settled in for another peaceful evening by the lake.

### Day 3

Leaving Kinloch at a reasonable time, heading for Te Anau. 

Arriving in the pouring rain, there was no sign of the eponymous Lake Te Anau, so we bunkered down and did our laundry instead. How exciting is travel!

That night we did at least one of the things we travelled there for: the glow worms. Super cool.

Unfortunately while waiting for the glow worm ferry, I noticed that the Milford Sound road was closed, which didn't bode well for our tour the next day. A phone call while boarding said boat confirmed the tour had been cancelled. We'd booked a slightly cheaper tour that was going to pick us up in Te Anau, but given we weren't coming back for the rest of the trip we rebooked a Queenstown-departing tour at the end of our trip. 

### Day 4

On the road again, towards Wanaka. Taking the PASS NAME, we encountered a snow flurry as we crossed ~600m in elevation. With no chains, we took the gamble as the road was still clear and no signs of ice. Plus, the road was still busy with standard traffic. Two aussies panicked, the kiwis took it in their stride.

Do you know what snow is at lower elevations? Rain. 

Wet Wanaka. 

Morale was low and the weather wet–we had come to Wanaka to enjoy the the beautify lakeside and climb Roy's Peak. Both were covered in cloud. 

We decided to do our laundry and bunker down for the evening, only to then discover the dryers at the camp didn't exactly dry your washing. After to runs at it, we were left with a sopping pile of clothes. 

Wet Wanaka.

### Day 5

Driving up the West Coast to Franz Josef Glacier there was a marked difference in the evniroment and scenery.
