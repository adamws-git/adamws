Last September, my partner and I headed across the ditch to Aotearoa/NZ for two weeks of exploration and adventure. While we had initial grand plans to do a couple of overnight hikes alongside a 'vanlife' roadtrip, the logistics to run both trips at the same time were too difficult.

## Welcome to Queenstown

Having arrived in Queenstown, we checked into our Airbnb–which was right at the top of a very steep hill mind (welcome to NZ lol). I'd organised the Uber to take us into the town centre due to the fact the Airbnb was meant to be walking distance. It was, hill and all included. Lesson learnt.

We'd arranged to have a few days in Queenstown proper to explore what is probably one of my favourite towns. It's like a ski resort on steroids–everyone there is there to have fun, forget about the corporate lifestyle and enjoy everything mother nature has to offer.

While in Queenstown, we hit a few of the OGs; the Shotover Jet, Ferg Burger as well as some of the lesser undertaken–we walked up towards Ben Lomond from the town centre, up the Tiwi trail and past the luge. More uphill.

## The van

Finding a van was really very easy. If the common joke about sheep in NZ applies, so should one about vans. They're everywhere. We found ours on a site called Camplify–which is a bit like Airbnb for vans and cars. People who may own a van and don't use it full time can rent it out at a daily cost, while the renter pays for fuel and tolls.

For a whopping NZD$100 a day, we had scored a _memorable_ Toyota Hiace from 1990. Makes it older than yours truly. 

We’re talking no airbags, no power steering, no A/C and a top speed of 40km/h at the mere sight of a slope. 

I loved it. 

The owners had fitted it out with a decent setup; bed, cabinetry (including a sink!) and a battery for the small fridge and electronics for when you’re parked up.
