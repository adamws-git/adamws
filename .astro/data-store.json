Here's an example of what valid frontmatter would look like:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: \"Customizing Miniblog\"\ndescription: \"How to customize the Miniblog blog theme.\"\ndate: \"Nov 26 2024\"\nimage: \"/static/blog-placeholder.png\"  \n---\n```\n\n> Note that the `image` frontmatter property is optional, and will by default use `/static/blog-placeholder.png`. You may update this by replacing the `/static/blog-placeholder.png` file in the `public/static/` directory with a file of your choice with the same name.\n\n## Codeblock Syntax Highlighting\n\nAstro has Markdown codeblock syntax highlighting out of the box by using [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) under the hood. To customize the themes used by Shiki, modify the `markdown.shikiConfig.themes` property of the `astro.config.mjs` file to one of the [themes](https://shiki.style/themes) provided by Shiki.\n\n## OpenGraph Image Support\n\nAs mentioned in the [Blog Posts](#blog-posts) section above, a default OpenGraph image is provided for all pages of the site.\n\nTo update the site-wide, default OpenGraph image, replace the `/static/blog-placeholder.png` file in the `public/static/` directory with a file of your choice with the same name.\n\nTo add a unique OpenGraph image for a specific blog post, add the new image to the `public/static/` directory, and update the `image` frontmatter property for the respective blog post to use the new image.\n\n## View Transitions\n\nView transitions, or page-to-page navigation animations, also come out of the box with Astro. Please review the Astro [View Transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/) documentation if you would like to modify the animations of the site.\n\n## Colors\n\nMiniblog uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for its styling, and therefore uses Tailwind's native color variables throughout the site. By default, Miniblog uses `neutral` for the majority of its colors, with the exception of links that use `blue` and codeblocks that utilize syntax highlighting.","src/content/posts/customizing-miniblog.md","4f61af7e9150b879",{"html":37,"metadata":38},"\u003Ch2 id=\"blog-posts\">Blog Posts\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>All blog posts should be saved as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.markdownguide.org/\">Markdown\u003C/a> or \u003Ca href=\"https://mdxjs.com/\">MDX\u003C/a> files within the \u003Ccode>src/content/posts/\u003C/code> directory, and have valid frontmatter as defined by the \u003Ccode>posts\u003C/code> content collection in the \u003Ccode>src/content/config.ts\u003C/code> file.
